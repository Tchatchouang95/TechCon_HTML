This project challenges you to build a comprehensive website for the TechCon 2024 conference using HTML. You’ll create various webpages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the conference, while incorporating essential HTML elements and best practices.

Concepts Covered:
Throughout this project, you’ll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

HTML Structure: You’ll solidify your understanding of fundamental HTML tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.
Headings and Text: You’ll learn to structure headings (h1-h6) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (<p>) and other text formatting elements effectively.
Links and Navigation: You’ll implement hyperlinks (<a> tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.
Tables: You’ll create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.
Forms: You’ll design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the <form> tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.
Images and Multimedia: You’ll incorporate images (using <img> tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. You’ll also explore embedding a promotional video (using the <video> tag) and an interactive Google Map (using <iframe>) on the Contact page.
